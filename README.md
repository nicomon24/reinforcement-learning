# reinforcement-learning

A collection of problems and solution to explore reinforcement learning.

## Multi Armed Bandit
Simple strategies to solve the MAB problem compared: epsilon-greedy, UCB1, optimistic search

## Tic Tac Toe
My implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game, played by an epsilon-greedy agent. Players are configurable: can be either humans or agents.
In this way, we can train 2 agents by making them play and then a human player can play against one of the 2.

# Atari Breakout
My implementation of the DQN algorithm by Google DeepMind, applied to the Atari Breakout game.
